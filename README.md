# 💳 MoPay — Smart Credit Card Optimizer

MoPay helps you **maximize your credit card rewards**.  
Every time you make a purchase, MoPay helps you decide which of your cards will get you the **best cashback or points** — automatically.

## 🧠 Why use MoPay?

Most people own multiple credit cards, each with different reward categories:

| Card | Category | Cashback |
|------|----------|----------|
| Chase Sapphire Preferred | Dining | 🍽️ 3x Points |
| Citi Double Cash         | Everything | 💵 2% Back |
| Amex Gold                | Groceries | 🛒 4x Points |

But remembering which one to use? Not easy.  
**MoPay makes it automatic.**
